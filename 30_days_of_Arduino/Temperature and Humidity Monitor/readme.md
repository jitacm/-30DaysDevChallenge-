# Temperature and Humidity Monitor Project

## Description
Build a temperature and humidity monitor using a DHT11 sensor and display the readings on an LCD connected to an Arduino board. This project is useful for environmental monitoring and indoor climate control.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- 16x2 LCD display
- Resistors (if needed for LCD backlight)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Connect the DHT11 sensor and LCD as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`temp_humidity_monitor.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. **Run**: Once uploaded, the LCD should display real-time temperature and humidity readings from the DHT11 sensor.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the DHT11 sensor is placed in a suitable environment for accurate readings.
- Calibrate the sensor if necessary for precise temperature and humidity measurements.

Expand the project by adding data logging or remote monitoring capabilities.

Enjoy monitoring temperature and humidity with your Arduino project!
