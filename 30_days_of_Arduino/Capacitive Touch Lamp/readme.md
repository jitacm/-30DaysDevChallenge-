# Capacitive Touch Lamp Project

## Description
Create a touch-sensitive lamp using Arduino, a capacitive touch sensor, and a relay module. Touching the capacitive sensor turns the lamp on or off.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- Capacitive touch sensor module
- Relay module (appropriate for controlling your lamp)
- Lamp (AC powered)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Connect the capacitive touch sensor, relay module, lamp, and Arduino as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`capacitive_touch_lamp.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. **Run**: Touch the capacitive sensor to turn the lamp on or off. The relay module will control the lamp based on your touch input.

## Additional Notes
- Adjust the `threshold` value in the Arduino code (`capacitive_touch_lamp.ino`) if needed to fine-tune touch sensitivity.
- Ensure the relay module is rated appropriately for your lamp's power requirements (voltage and current).
- Implement safety measures, such as proper insulation and grounding, when working with AC-powered devices.

Enjoy building and using your capacitive touch lamp with Arduino!
