# Heart Rate Monitor Project

## Description
Create a heart rate monitor using Arduino with a pulse sensor and display the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM) on a 16x2 LCD.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- Pulse sensor module
- 16x2 LCD display
- Resistors (if needed)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Connect the pulse sensor, LCD, and Arduino as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`heart_rate_monitor.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. **Run**: Place the pulse sensor on your finger or wrist. The LCD will display your heart rate in real-time.

## Additional Notes
- Adjust the `period` variable in the Arduino code (`heart_rate_monitor.ino`) to fine-tune the heart rate measurement interval.
- Ensure the pulse sensor is properly positioned and secured to get accurate heart rate readings.
- You may need to calibrate the sensor and adjust thresholds based on your application and environment.

Enjoy monitoring your heart rate with Arduino!
