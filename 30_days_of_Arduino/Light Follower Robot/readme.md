# Motion Detector Project

## Description
This project uses a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to detect motion and can trigger an alarm or light (LED) connected to an Arduino board. PIR sensors are commonly used in security systems and automation.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor module
- Buzzer or LED (for indication)
- Resistors (if needed for LED or buzzer)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`motion_detector.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. **Run**: Once uploaded, observe the LED (or listen for the buzzer) to detect motion when someone moves in front of the PIR sensor.

## Additional Notes
- Adjust sensitivity and timing of the PIR sensor if necessary.
- Modify the code to integrate more complex actions such as sending notifications or controlling other devices.

Enhance the project by adding features like data logging or remote monitoring using wireless modules.

Have fun experimenting with motion detection using Arduino!
