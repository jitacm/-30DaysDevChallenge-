# Gesture Controlled Robot Project

## Description
Create a gesture-controlled robot using Arduino and an accelerometer. Control the robot's movements (forward, backward, left, right) by tilting the accelerometer in different directions.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- Accelerometer module (e.g., ADXL345)
- Motor driver module (appropriate for your motors)
- Motors (DC motors suitable for your robot chassis)
- Robot chassis
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Connect the accelerometer, motor driver, motors, and Arduino as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`gesture_controlled_robot.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. **Run**: Tilt the accelerometer module to control the robot's movements. Adjust accelerometer thresholds in the code if needed for better gesture recognition.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the motor driver is capable of handling the current requirements of your motors.
- Customize the motor control logic in the Arduino code (`gesture_controlled_robot.ino`) to match your robot's motor configuration.
- Experiment with different gestures and sensitivity settings for a better control experience.

Enjoy building and controlling your gesture-controlled robot with Arduino!
