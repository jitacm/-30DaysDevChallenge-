# Remote Controlled Car Project

## Description
Build a remote-controlled car using an IR (Infrared) remote control and Arduino. The car moves in different directions (forward, backward, left, right) based on signals received from the IR remote.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- IR receiver module
- Motors (DC motors)
- Motor driver module (e.g., L298N)
- Robot chassis with wheels
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Mount IR receiver module on the car chassis and connect it to Arduino input pin.
2. **Motor Control**: Connect motors to motor driver outputs and Arduino digital pins for motor control.
3. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`remote_controlled_car.ino`) to your Arduino board.
4. **Remote Control**: Use an IR remote to send commands to the car (e.g., forward, backward, left, right).

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the IR remote and receiver are compatible and configured properly.
- Customize the Arduino code to interpret different IR remote buttons for various car movements.

Enhance the project by adding features like obstacle avoidance or speed control.

Enjoy building and controlling your remote-controlled car with Arduino!
