# LED Blink Project

## Description
This project demonstrates how to blink an LED using an Arduino board. It's a simple introductory project to learn the basics of controlling hardware with Arduino.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- LED (any color)
- Resistor (220 ohms is commonly used)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`led_blink.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. **Run**: Once uploaded, the LED should start blinking at 1-second intervals.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure to use the appropriate resistor to limit current to the LED to avoid damaging it.
- Modify the `delay()` function calls to change the blinking speed of the LED.

Have fun tinkering with your Arduino and exploring further projects!
