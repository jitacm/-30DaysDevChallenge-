# Light Follower Robot Project

## Description
Build a robot that follows light using photoresistors and an Arduino board. The robot adjusts its movement direction based on the intensity of light detected by the photoresistors.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- Photoresistors (2)
- Motors (DC motors)
- Motor driver module (e.g., L298N)
- Robot chassis
- Wheels and motors for movement
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Mount photoresistors on the front of the robot chassis, connect them to Arduino analog input pins.
2. **Motor Control**: Connect motors to motor driver outputs and Arduino digital pins for motor control.
3. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`light_follower_robot.ino`) to your Arduino board.
4. **Run**: Once uploaded, place the robot in an environment with varying light intensities. It should follow light sources detected by the photoresistors.

## Additional Notes
- Calibrate the robot's response to light intensity by adjusting threshold values in the Arduino code.
- Experiment with different light sources and environments to test the robot's performance.

Expand the project by adding obstacle avoidance or remote control functionalities.

Have fun building your light-following robot with Arduino!
