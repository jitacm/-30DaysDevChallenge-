# Weather Station Project

## Description
Build a basic weather station using Arduino to display temperature, humidity, and pressure. This project combines data from a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity, and a BMP180 sensor for pressure. Data is displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- BMP180 pressure sensor
- 16x2 LCD display with I2C interface
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Connect the DHT11 sensor, BMP180 sensor, and LCD display as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`weather_station.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. **Run**: Once uploaded, the LCD will display real-time temperature, humidity, and pressure readings from the sensors.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the sensors are placed in suitable environments for accurate readings.
- Calibrate the sensors if necessary for precise measurements.

Expand the project by adding data logging capabilities or integrating it with online weather services for extended functionality.

Enjoy building your weather station with Arduino!
