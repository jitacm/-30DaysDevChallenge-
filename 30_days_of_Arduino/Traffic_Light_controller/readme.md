# Traffic Light Controller Project

## Description
This project simulates a traffic light system using LEDs and an Arduino board. It cycles through the typical sequence of red, red-yellow, green, and yellow lights.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- Red, yellow, and green LEDs
- Resistors (appropriate values for LEDs)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`traffic_light_controller.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. **Run**: Once uploaded, observe the LEDs to simulate the traffic light sequence.

## Additional Notes
- Adjust the `delay()` times in the Arduino code to change the duration of each light phase.
- Ensure proper resistor values for the LEDs to avoid damage.

Expand the project by adding pedestrian crossing signals or sensor-based traffic light control.

Have fun simulating traffic lights with Arduino!
