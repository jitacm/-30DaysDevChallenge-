# Digital Stopwatch Project

## Description
Create a digital stopwatch using Arduino with start, stop, and reset functionality displayed on a 16x2 LCD. The stopwatch measures elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- 16x2 LCD display
- Two push buttons (for start/stop and reset)
- Resistors (if needed for the push buttons)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Connect the LCD, push buttons, and Arduino as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`digital_stopwatch.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. **Run**: Use the start/stop button to control the stopwatch. Press the reset button to reset the stopwatch to zero.

## Additional Notes
- Adjust the debounce delay (`delay(200)`) in the Arduino code if needed for better button responsiveness.
- Customize the LCD display messages and formatting in the Arduino code to suit your preferences.
- Enhance the project by adding lap time functionality or saving time records.

Enjoy building and using your digital stopwatch with Arduino!
