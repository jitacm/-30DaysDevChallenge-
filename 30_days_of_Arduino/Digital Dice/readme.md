# Digital Dice Project

## Description
Simulate a dice roll using an Arduino, a push button, and a two-digit seven-segment display. Each press of the button will display a random dice value (1-6) on the display.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- Push button
- Common cathode seven-segment display (2-digit)
- Resistors (if needed for the display)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Connect the push button and seven-segment display as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`digital_dice.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. **Run**: Press the button to simulate a dice roll. The result will be displayed on the seven-segment display.

## Additional Notes
- Adjust the `delay` times in the Arduino code (`loop()` function) to control how long each dice value is displayed before resetting.
- Enhance the project by adding sound effects or extending the display to show more dice faces.

Enjoy simulating dice rolls with your Arduino-based digital dice project!
