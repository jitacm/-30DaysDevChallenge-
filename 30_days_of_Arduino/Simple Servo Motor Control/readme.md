# Simple Servo Motor Control Project

## Description
This project allows you to control the position of a servo motor using a potentiometer connected to an Arduino board. As you rotate the potentiometer, the servo motor will move to different positions corresponding to the potentiometer's position.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- Servo motor
- Potentiometer
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`servo_motor_control.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. **Run**: Once uploaded, adjust the potentiometer to see the servo motor move to different positions.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the servo motor is powered appropriately (usually through the Arduino's 5V pin or an external power source).
- Adjust the `delay()` in the Arduino code if the servo motor movement is jittery or unstable.

Explore further by integrating additional sensors or controls for more complex servo motor applications.
