# Simple Alarm System Project

## Description
Create a simple alarm system using an Arduino, a keypad, and a piezo buzzer. The alarm can be activated and deactivated using a predefined code entered via the keypad. 

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- Keypad (4x4 or similar)
- Piezo buzzer
- Resistors (if needed for buzzer)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Connect the keypad and piezo buzzer as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`simple_alarm_system.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. **Run**: Once uploaded, enter the correct alarm code via the keypad to activate or deactivate the alarm.

## Additional Notes
- Modify the `alarmCode` variable in the Arduino code to set your desired alarm code.
- Customize the alarm behavior (e.g., add more security features or notifications) based on your requirements.

Enhance the project by integrating it with sensors or connecting it to a monitoring system.

Enjoy building your simple alarm system with Arduino!
