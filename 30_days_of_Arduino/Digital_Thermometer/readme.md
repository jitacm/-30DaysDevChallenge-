# Digital Thermometer Project

## Description
This project measures temperature using a DS18B20 temperature sensor and displays it on an LCD connected to an Arduino board. It's a practical project for monitoring temperature in various applications.

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- DS18B20 temperature sensor
- 16x2 LCD display
- Resistor (4.7k ohms for DS18B20)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a circuit diagram image here if you create one.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code (`digital_thermometer.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. **Run**: Once uploaded, the LCD should display the current temperature read by the DS18B20 sensor.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure proper connections and resistor values for reliable temperature readings.
- Calibrate the sensor if necessary for accurate temperature measurements.

Explore further by integrating additional sensors or displaying temperature in Fahrenheit.

Have fun with your Arduino thermometer project!
