## A) HACKBLITZ 2024 HACKATHON RULES
These are the Hack blitz standard competition rules: This
document serves as an rulebook to the Hack blitz 2024
hackathon. It explains and expands on the rules detailed in the
Hack blitz 2024.
## B) THE RULES OF THE COMPETITION
1. A team can have a maximum of 4 members.
2. Teams should be made up exclusively of accepted
members who are not organizers, volunteers, mentors,
judges, sponsors, or any other privileged position at the
event.
3. Teams can gain advice and support from organizers,
volunteers, sponsors, and others.
4. All work on a project must be done at the hackathon.
5. Teams can use libraries, frameworks. Working on a project
before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of
using the code during the event is against the spirit of the
rules and is not allowed.
6) Teams must stop Code once the time is up. However,
teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their
programs after time is up. e.g. If during presenting you find a
bug or exception that breaks your application and the fix is
only a few lines of code, it’s okay to fix that. Making large
changes or adding new features is not allowed.
7) Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the
organizers’ discretion. Reasons might include but are not
limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the [Code
of Conduct], or other unsporting behaviour.
## C) SUBMISSION
instructions will be given during hackathon
## D) JUDGING CRITERIA
Teams will be judged on following points. During judging,
participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion
in their project For example how well designed is the interface?
For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or
graphics are. These criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges
are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which
projects are the most impressive and most deserving.
It’s important to note that these judging criteria do not include:
How good your code is. It doesn’t matter if your code is messy,
or not well commented. Code is about playing around, making
mistakes, and learning new things. If your code isn’t production
ready, we’re not going to mark you down. - How well you pitch.
Code is about building and learning, not about selling. - How well
the project solves a problem. You can build something totally
useless and as long as you’re learning and having fun..
