# Tip Calculator

A simple Tip Calculator built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to help you calculate the tip amount and total bill based on the bill amount and desired tip percentage.

## Introduction
The Tip Calculator is designed to assist users in quickly calculating the amount of tip to leave at restaurants or other service-based establishments. It also helps in determining the total amount to be paid after adding the tip to the original bill amount.

## Features
- Calculate tip based on bill amount and tip percentage.
- Display both the tip amount and the total amount (bill amount + tip).
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Description
The Tip Calculator takes in two inputs from the user:
1. **Bill Amount**: The total amount of the bill.
2. **Tip Percentage**: The percentage of the bill amount that the user wishes to leave as a tip.

Upon clicking the "Calculate Tip" button, the calculator performs the following calculations:
- **Tip Amount**: Calculated as `billAmount * (tipPercentage / 100)`.
- **Total Amount**: Calculated as `billAmount + tipAmount`.

The results are then displayed to the user, showing both the tip amount and the total amount to be paid.
