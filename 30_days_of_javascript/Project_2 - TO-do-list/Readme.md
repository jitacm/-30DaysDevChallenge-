# To-Do List Application

A simple To-Do List app built with modern JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3. It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, displaying them in an aesthetic and interactive interface.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Input a task in the text field and add it to your list by clicking the "Add Task" button or pressing "Enter".
- **Complete Tasks:** Click on a task to toggle its completion status; completed tasks are visually crossed out.
- **Edit Tasks:** Click on the task text to edit it directly. Changes are saved automatically when you click outside the text field.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list by clicking the "X" button next to each task.
- **Scrollable Task List:** The task list becomes scrollable when there are too many tasks to fit on the screen.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are stored locally in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence between sessions.
