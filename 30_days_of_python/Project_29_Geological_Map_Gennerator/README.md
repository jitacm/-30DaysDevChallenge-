The Geological Map Generator is a software tool designed for geologists, researchers, and educators to create, visualize, and analyze detailed geological maps. This tool supports various data formats and provides extensive customization options for creating comprehensive geological representations.

## Features

- **Geological Data Import**: Import geological data from CSV, shapefiles, and GeoJSON formats.
  
- **Map Creation**: Generate geological maps with multiple layers representing different geological features such as formations, faults, and mineral deposits.
  
- **Visualization**: Display geological features using customizable color schemes, symbols, and 3D visualization for enhanced representation.
  
- **Customization**: Customize map layers with options for color, transparency, labels, and symbols to suit specific needs.
  
- **Analysis Tools**: Measure distances, areas, and angles within the map to aid in geological analysis.
  
- **Export**: Export maps as high-quality images or interactive HTML files for presentations and further analysis.
  
- **User Interface**: Intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for easy map creation and customization.
  
- **Scripting**: Advanced users can write custom scripts to automate complex map generation tasks and perform detailed analysis.
