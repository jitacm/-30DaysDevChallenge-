**Code Description:**

This Python code snippet implements a real-time face detection application using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library). It effectively identifies and displays rectangles around human faces captured through a webcam. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code's functionality:

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - `cv2`: This line imports the OpenCV library, a powerful suite of functions for real-time computer vision tasks like image and video processing, object detection, and more.

2. **Load Face Detection Model:**
   - `face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')`:
     - This line creates a `face_cascade` object, which is a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier specifically designed for detecting frontal human faces.
     - `cv2.CascadeClassifier`: This is a function within OpenCV that loads pre-trained face detection models stored in the XML format.
     - `cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml'`: This path points to the default Haar Cascade face detection model file included with OpenCV. This model was trained on a large dataset of human faces and can reliably detect faces in frontal orientations.

3. **Capture Video Stream:**
   - `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)`: This line initializes a `VideoCapture` object named `cap`, which captures video input from the default webcam (index 0). If you have multiple cameras connected, you can specify a different index to capture video from a specific camera.

4. **Video Processing Loop:**
   - `while True:`: This line starts an infinite loop that continuously processes video frames from the webcam. This loop keeps the application running until the user manually exits.

     - **Read Frame:**
       - `ret, frame = cap.read()`:
         - This line reads a single frame (image) from the video capture object (`cap`).
         - `ret`: This variable stores a boolean value indicating whether the frame was successfully read (True) or not (False).
         - `frame`: This variable holds the captured frame as a NumPy array, which is the primary data structure used in OpenCV for image manipulation.

     - **Convert to Grayscale:**
       - `gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`:
         - This line converts the captured frame (`frame`), which is likely in BGR (Blue, Green, Red) color format, to grayscale format. Face detection models typically perform more efficiently on grayscale images, as color information is often less relevant for identifying facial features.

     - **Detect Faces:**
       - `faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4)`:
         - This line is the heart of the face detection process. It uses the loaded `face_cascade` model to detect faces in the grayscale frame (`gray`).
         - `face_cascade.detectMultiScale`: This method performs the actual face detection. It takes three arguments:
           - `gray`: The grayscale image to search for faces in.
           - `1.1`: This is a scale factor used for multi-scale detection. It indicates how much the image size is scaled down between successive detection attempts (slightly increasing the scale in each iteration allows for detection of faces of different sizes).
           - `4`: This is the minimum number of neighbors required to consider a region a face. Higher values result in stricter detection (fewer false positives) but may also miss some smaller or less prominent faces.
         - `faces`: This variable stores an array of rectangles representing the detected faces in the frame. Each rectangle is defined by four values: `(x, y, w, h)`, where `x` and `y` are the top-left corner coordinates, `w` is the width, and `h` is the height of the detected face region.

     - **Draw Rectangles:**
       - The `for` loop iterates through each detected face (`(x, y, w, h)`) in the `faces` array.
         - `cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (255, 0, 0), 2)`:
           - This line draws a blue rectangle (color: `(255, 0, 0)`) around the detected face using the `cv2.rectangle` function. The rectangle's coordinates are defined by `(x, y)` for the top-
