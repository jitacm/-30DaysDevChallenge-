**Imports:**

- `random`: This library provides functionalities for generating random numbers, used to create random short URLs.
- `string`: This library offers access to string constants, including `string.ascii_letters` for lowercase and uppercase letters and `string.digits` for digits (0-9).

**URL Mapping Dictionary:**

- `url_mapping`: This dictionary serves as the central storage for the URL shortening process. It maps short URLs (keys) to their corresponding original URLs (values).

**Functions:**

- `shorten_url(url)`: This function takes a long URL as input.

  - **Generating Short URL:**
    - `''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters + string.digits, k=6))`: This line generates a random string of 6 characters using `random.choices`. It selects characters from the combined string of lowercase and uppercase letters (`string.ascii_letters`) and digits (`string.digits`). The result is joined into a single string using `''.join`.
  - **Storing Mapping:**
    - It stores this randomly generated short URL as the key and the original `url` as the value in the `url_mapping` dictionary.
  - **Returning Short URL:**
    - It returns the generated short URL.

- `get_original_url(short_url)`: This function takes a short URL as input.

  - **Retrieving Original URL:**
    - It uses the `get` method on the `url_mapping` dictionary to retrieve the original URL associated with the provided `short_url`. The `get` method returns the value if the key exists, otherwise it returns `None` (indicating the short URL was not found).

**User Interaction:**

- The code prompts the user to enter a URL to be shortened using `input`.
- It calls the `shorten_url` function with the entered URL to generate a short URL.
- It prints the generated short URL to the console.

- Then, it prompts the user to enter a short URL to retrieve the original URL.
- It calls the `get_original_url` function with the entered short URL.
- It checks the returned value. If it's not `None` (meaning the short URL was found in the mapping), it prints the original URL associated with the short URL. Otherwise, it can be enhanced to print a message indicating the short URL was not found.

**Potential Enhancements:**

- **Error Handling:** Implement checks to handle invalid URLs (e.g., missing protocol like http:// or https://).
- **Collision Handling:** If a randomly generated short URL already exists in the mapping, regenerate another one to avoid conflicts.
- **Persistence:** Consider saving the URL mapping to a file (e.g., JSON) to persist data even after program termination. This would allow the same short URLs to be used even if the program is restarted.
- **Custom Short URLs:** Explore allowing users to specify a custom short URL (within limitations to avoid conflicts).
