**Data Structure:**

- `library`: This variable is a list that stores dictionaries containing book information. Each dictionary has two key-value pairs:
    - `title`: The title of the book (as a string).
    - `author`: The author of the book (as a string).

**Functions:**

- `add_book(title, author)`: This function takes two arguments, `title` and `author`, representing the book's details. It creates a new dictionary with these details, appends it to the `library` list, and prints a confirmation message.

- `view_books()`: This function checks if the `library` list is empty. If it is, it prints a message stating there are no books. Otherwise, it iterates through the `library` list using a `for` loop with `enumerate()`. The `enumerate` function assigns an index (starting from 1) to each book dictionary in the list. Inside the loop, it retrieves the book title and author from the current dictionary and prints them in a formatted way, displaying the book's index, title, and author.

- `remove_book(index)`: This function takes an `index` argument representing the position (number) of the book to remove in the `library` list. It performs the following checks:
    - If the provided `index` is within valid bounds (between 1 and the length of the `library` list), it removes the book at that index from the list using `pop(index - 1)`. The `pop` method removes an element at a specific index and returns it. Here, `index - 1` adjusts for zero-based indexing in Python (lists start at index 0).
    - If the `index` is invalid (out of range), it prints an error message.
  After a successful removal, it prints a message confirming the removal of the book by its title and author.

**Main Loop:**

- The `while True` loop ensures the program runs continuously until the user exits.

  - **Menu:**
    - Inside the loop, the code displays a menu with four options:
      1. Add Book
      2. View Books
      3. Remove Book
      4. Exit
    - The user is prompted to enter their choice.

  - **Choice Handling:**
    - An `if...elif...else` statement handles the user's choice:
      - If the choice is '1' (Add Book), the `add_book` function is called to add a new book.
      - If the choice is '2' (View Books), the `view_books` function is called to display all existing books.
      - If the choice is '3' (Remove Book), the `remove_book` function is called to remove a book based on its index (number).
      - If the choice is '4' (Exit), the loop breaks, terminating the program.
      - Any other choice is considered invalid, and an error message is printed.

**Overall Functionality:**

This code provides a basic library management system that allows users to add new books, view existing books in the library, and remove books.

**Potential Enhancements:**

- **Search Functionality:** Allow users to search for specific books by title or author.
- **Borrowing System:** Implement functionality to track borrowed books and their due dates.
- **Persistence:** Consider saving the library data to a file (e.g., JSON, CSV) to persist information even after program termination.
- **User Interface:** Explore creating a more graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt for a more user-friendly experience.
