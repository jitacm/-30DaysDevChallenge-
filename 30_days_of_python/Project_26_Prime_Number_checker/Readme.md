**Function Definition:**

- `def is_prime(n):`: This line defines a function named `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value (True or False) indicating whether `n` is a prime number.

**Primality Check:**

- The function first checks for base cases using an `if` statement:
    - `if n <= 1`: If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it's not considered prime by definition. The function returns `False` in this case.

- **Efficient Trial Division:**
    - It uses a `for` loop to iterate through potential divisors of `n`. The loop starts at 2 (`i in range(2, ...)`) because 1 is a trivial divisor for any number, and we're interested in non-trivial factors. It iterates up to the square root of `n` (`int(n**0.5) + 1`) because any composite number can be expressed as the product of two factors, one of which must be less than or equal to its square root.
    - Inside the loop:
        - `if n % i == 0`: This condition checks if `n` is divisible by the current divisor `i`. If it is divisible (meaning there's no remainder after division), it signifies that `n` is not prime and the function immediately returns `False`.

- **Prime Number:**
    - If the loop completes without finding any divisors, it reaches the `return True` statement at the end. This implies `n` wasn't divisible by any number in the checked range, and therefore, it's classified as a prime number. The function returns `True` in this case.

**Main Execution (not part of the function):**

- `number = int(input("Enter a number: "))`: This line prompts the user to enter a number using `input`. The `int` function converts the user input (which is a string) to an integer.
- `if is_prime(number):`: This line calls the `is_prime` function with the entered `number` to check its primality.
- Based on the result returned by `is_prime` (True or False), the code either prints a message indicating whether the number is prime or not.
