To-Do List Application

This Python script implements a simple command-line to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks. The application enables users to add tasks, view the current list of tasks, and remove tasks by specifying their position in the list. The application runs in an infinite loop, presenting the user with options to interact with their to-do list until they choose to exit. Below is a detailed description of each component and the overall functionality.

1. Add Task: Prompts the user to enter a new task and adds it to the list.
2. Remove Task: Prompts the user to enter the number of the task they want to remove and deletes the corresponding task.
3. Exit: Breaks the loop and exits the application.
4. Invalid Choice: If the user enters an invalid option, it notifies them and re-displays the menu.

How to Use the Application

1. Run the Script: Start the script using a Python interpreter.
2. View Tasks: The current tasks are displayed initially and after each operation.
3. Add a Task: Select option 1, then enter the task description when prompted. The task will be added to the list.
4. Remove a Task: Select option 2, then enter the number corresponding to the task you want to remove.
5. Exit: Select option 3 to exit the application.
