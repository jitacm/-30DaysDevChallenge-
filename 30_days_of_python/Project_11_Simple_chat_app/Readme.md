Simple Chat Application Using Sockets in Python

This simple chat application allows users to communicate with each other over a network using sockets in Python. It demonstrates basic concepts of networking and concurrency using the socket and threading modules. Here's a detailed description and code implementation for the client side of the chat application.

Description:

The chat application consists of a client that connects to a server using a socket. The client sends and receives messages, allowing multiple users to chat with each other in real-time. The application uses threading to handle sending and receiving messages simultaneously, ensuring a seamless chat experience.

Steps Involved:

1. Initialize and Connect the Client Socket:

2. The client socket is created using the socket.socket function with AF_INET (IPv4) and SOCK_STREAM (TCP).
3. The client connects to the server's IP address (localhost 127.0.0.1 in this example) and port number 55555.
4. Nickname Selection:

The user is prompted to choose a nickname, which will be used to identify them in the chat.
Receive Function:

5. A separate thread is dedicated to receiving messages from the server.
This function continuously listens for messages from the server. If the message is 'NICK', it sends the user's nickname to the server.
Otherwise, it prints any received messages.
6. Write Function:
Another thread is dedicated to sending messages.
This function continuously prompts the user for input, formats it with their nickname, and sends it to the server.
7. Threading:
Two threads are created: one for the receive function and one for the write function.
This allows the client to simultaneously send and receive messages without blocking either operation.
