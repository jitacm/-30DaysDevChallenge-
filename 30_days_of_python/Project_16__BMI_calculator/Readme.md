**Functionality:**

This Python program calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on your weight and height and provides a corresponding interpretation of your weight category.

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Define BMI Calculation Function:**
   - `def calculate_bmi(weight, height):`: This line defines a function named `calculate_bmi` that takes two arguments: `weight` (in kilograms) and `height` (in meters).
   - `return weight / (height ** 2)`: Inside the function, this line calculates the BMI using the standard formula: weight divided by height squared. The result is returned by the function.

2. **Get User Input:**
   - `weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))`: This line prompts the user to enter their weight in kilograms using the `input` function. The input is converted to a floating-point number using `float` and stored in the `weight` variable.
   - `height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))`: This line similarly prompts the user to enter their height in meters. The input is converted to a float and stored in the `height` variable.

3. **Calculate and Display BMI:**
   - `bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)`: This line calls the `calculate_bmi` function, passing the user-entered `weight` and `height` as arguments. The calculated BMI is stored in the `bmi` variable.
   - `print(f"Your BMI is {bmi:.2f}")`: This line uses f-strings (formatted string literals) to print a message to the user, displaying their calculated BMI with two decimal places for better readability.

4. **Interpret BMI Category:**
   - The `if...elif...else` statement block categorizes the user's weight based on the calculated BMI:
     - `if bmi < 18.5:`: If the BMI is less than 18.5, it indicates underweight, and a message is printed.
     - `elif 18.5 <= bmi < 24.9:`: If the BMI falls between 18.5 and 24.9 (inclusive), it suggests a normal weight, and a message is printed.
     - `elif 25 <= bmi < 29.9:`: A BMI between 25 and 29.9 (inclusive) is considered overweight, and a message is displayed.
     - `else:`: If the BMI is 30 or above, it falls into the obese category, and a message is printed.

**Important Considerations:**

- BMI is a general guideline and may not be equally applicable to everyone, particularly for individuals with high muscle mass or certain medical conditions. It's recommended to consult a healthcare professional for a more personalized assessment.
- The code assumes weight in kilograms and height in meters. You can modify the prompts and calculations if you prefer to use different units.
