Description
The "Guess the Number" Program is a simple, interactive Program where the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range (typically between 1 and 100), and the User attempts to guess this number. After each guess, the Program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The Program continues until the User correctly guesses the number, at which point the Program congratulates the User and displays the number of attempts made.

Use
The "Guess the Number" Program serves multiple educational purposes, including:

1. Learning Basic Control Structures: It introduces beginners to loops (for repeatedly prompting for guesses) and conditionals (for evaluating each guess).
2. Working with Random Numbers: It demonstrates the use of the random module to generate random numbers, a common task in many programming scenarios.
3. User Input and Output: It provides practice with getting input from users and displaying output, essential for any interactive program.
4. Problem-Solving Skills: It encourages logical thinking and problem-solving, as Users must use the feedback to narrow down their guesses.

How to Start
1. Start the Program: Run the script to start the game.
2. Make a Guess: Enter a number between 1 and 100 when prompted.
3. Receive Feedback: The program will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Continue Guessing: Keep entering guesses based on the feedback until you guess the correct number.
5. Win the Game: When you guess the correct number, the program congratulates you and tells you how many attempts you made.
